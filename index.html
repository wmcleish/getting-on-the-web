            They used their Tufts degrees to start a band? 
            Are they crazy? Yes, but sensical in having the 
            where-with-all to choose the right path, not 
            the road most traveled. Emperor Jones is a 
            funky, rocky, bluesy band with a modernized 
            feel. Coming from different parts of America 
            and the world, their musical influence is vast, 
            superimposing their musical composition. Currently 
            gigging locally in the Boston area, Emperor Jones 
            has their sights set on the rest of the globe, and 
            they certainly contain the dynamic talent to do so.
